# Project 2: Classification

This project consisted on implementing Bayes Classification, making an iid assumption (independent and identically distributed), and asuming a Normal distribution.

* hw2_classification.py: Given training and test data, creates a csv (output) with the posterior probabilities of x in Xtest, of being in each class.



##To execute the code:

`python hw2_classification.py <X_train.csv> <y_train.csv> <X_test.csv>`
