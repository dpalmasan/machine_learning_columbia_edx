# Project 3: Clustering

This project consisted on implementing Bayes Classification, making an iid assumption (independent and identically distributed), and asuming a Normal distribution.

* hw3_clustering.py: Given some data, creates a csv (output) with data about 10 iterations of K-means and EM-GMM.
* hw3_visualization.py: Visualize clusters for a 2-d space data.



## To execute the code:

`python hw3_clustering.py <X.csv>`

`python hw3_visualization.py`
